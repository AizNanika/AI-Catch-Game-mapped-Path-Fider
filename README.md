# AI Catch Game

A Student AI Project based on the "Sanke Game AI" project from [patrickloeber](https://github.com/patrickloeber/snake-ai-pytorch). Goal of this game is to teach an AI Agent how to navigate a playfield with or without objects to maximize the score and minimize running into collision.
