# AI-Catch-Game-mapped-Path-Fider
A Project where two AIÂ´s are competing with each other. One of them (blue) is the hunter and its goal is to catch the opponent (red). The clue is, that the red square is running away. Both squares learn from each other and develop tactics to either catch faster or run away better! BASED ON SNAKE!
